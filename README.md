What is Compute?
----------------

Compute aims to be the last blockchain. Compute uses the latest API's to perform complex quantitative methods with a portion of computing power donated to not-for-profit Organizations. An experimental digital infrastructure that enables real-time block-chain interactions as well as apps ontop of an anonymous, instant payment infrastructure available from anywhere in the world. Compute Core uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. X11 Algorythm Hybrid PoW / PoS Blockchain. Compute Nodes can be purchased for 10,000  PUTEz. Compute Core proposes to create a complete Supply chain including resolving issues in order placements from security and paying employees, subdivisions/partners, advertisers, and research and development. Compute Core is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
Master Nodes will be rewarded a higher rate of return on their investment. Master Nodes must be running 24/7 in order to verify the blockchain and will be compensated as such. Since Master Nodes require DDoS protection, they will be the heart of the network and will carry out a majority of computations. Similar to a bond note where you recieve a return on your investment per annum at specified amounts. However, unlike bond notes, you do not recieve your investment back, only reap a high rate of return on your investment. Compute Core is a fork of Dash. With a strong foothold in DDoS protected Datacenters world wide, Compute Core's developer launched all BIP heights yesterday cuncurrently within 1 year consensus.  The reason X11 Algorythms will be at the Core of Compute Core's encryption, over Scrypt, is because it over  10% faster and offers other benefits such as auto switching between 11 different algorythms. Therefore, PUTEz are not easily produced. Not only from Proof of Work, bit also Proof of Stake, ie. Master Node payments will miners be rewarded. Compute core is a Hybrid PoW/PoS blockhain. Compute miners/early adoptors will be rewarded , not only generating blocks, but also a percentage return that sees no deflation. Generating cocurrency interchange, however requires a lot of power useage and is not easily performed. Generating a hash requires a complex energy consuming mathametical computation that requires much work. Furthermore, once the blockchain attains a certan size difficulty increases exponentially. With automatic difficulty retargeting, 51% become nearly impossible. These coins could not be generated any other way. For this to be done the main network must be protected from DDoS attacks. The reason for choosing DDoS IPv4 IP's is for the following reasons: They can be encoded into IPv6 Hex's easily. They are harder to DDoS because they must be run through a program called wireshark in order to decipher

information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Development is normally done in separate branches.
[Tags](https://github.com/minblock/computesy/tags) are created to indicate new official,
stable release versions of Compute Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Compute Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/computesy/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.

Translators should also follow the [forum](https://www.Compute.ca/forum/topic/compute-worldwide-collaboration.88/).
